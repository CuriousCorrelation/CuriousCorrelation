- 👋 Hi, I’m @CuriousCorrelation because some correlations are quite curious 🤔
- 👀 I’m interested in everything software and computing
- 🧰 Tools of the trade are custom kernel, Gentoo, SwayWM, Alacritty, Doom Emacs, fzf, ripgrep, git, conventional commits, LSP, tree-sitter
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on and explore rust, distributed services and web apps!
