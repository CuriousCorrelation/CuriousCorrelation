- 👋 Hi, I’m @CuriousCorrelation because some correlations are quite curious 🤔
- 👀 I’m interested in anything software and computing
- 🧰 Tools of the craft are custom linux kernel, Gentoo, SwayWM, Evil Emacs, git, conventional commits, LSP, tree-sitter 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning frontend reactive frameworks, React and Svelte (techinically a compiler)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything! Programming is the language, programming languages are dialects, if it's not too esoteric, I can pick it up! I especially love C, Haskell and Rust.
- 📫 Hit me up at curiouscorrelation@gmail.com
- 🕐 Fully booked for contract works till Jan 23!
